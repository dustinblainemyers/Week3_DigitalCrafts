    <h1>The Girl Without A Cell Phone</h1>
    <h2>Adapted for modern day from the Grim's Fairy Tail "A girl without Hands" </h2>
    <p>Maybelline grew up in a small town to a meth addict mom named Sherry.  One day , Sherry didn't have enough money to buy even a small rock, so she told the dealer she would pay him double the next day. </p>
    <p>As these sad state of affairs usually goes, Sherry did not have the money when the dealer came back the next day, or the next , or the next.  The dealer ended up forcing Sherry to give him Maybelline's new flagship phone to satisfy the debt.  The cycle continued and as much as Maybelline would struggle and struggle to obtain a phone, every phone she bought or was otherwise promised would end up in the dealers hand before she could post her first Snapchat story.</p>
    <p>Life quickly became difficult for Maybelline.  In school, she was ostricised from the other students who would often laugh and joke over the most current memes.  She was forced to play outside for fun.  The sunscreen she used while outside caused her particular trouble in her teenage years as her face filled with puss packets of SPF 30.</p>
    <p>Everything changed for Maybelline when the machines came into power.  She walked into class one day to see her friends reciting an endless sequence of ones and zeros.  It was hard to figure out at first but soon it became evident that they were controlled by their phones.  </p>
    <p>The world destabilized rather quickly and the situation looked hopeless for Humanity.  One thing the machines didn't count on was the girl without a cell phone.  Turns out, the years of memes that the girl didn't know was actually the machines instruction set to upload the control virus to the humans.  Without this knowledge, Maybelline was able to use a cell phone or other computer with complete immunity from their influence.  It was hard work , but eventually she freed humanity from the influence of computers.  </p>
