    <h1>The Girl Without A Cell Phone</h1>
    <h2>Adapted for modern day from the Grim's Fairy Tail "A girl without Hands" </h2>
    <p>Maybelline grew up in a small town to a meth addict mom named Sherry.  One day , Sherry didn't have enough money to buy even a small rock, so she told the dealer she would pay him double the next day. </p>
    <p>As these sad state of affairs usually goes, Sherry did not have the money when the dealer came back the next day, or the next , or the next.  The dealer ended up forcing Sherry to give him Maybelline's new flagship phone to satisfy the debt.  The cycle continued and as much as Maybelline would struggle and struggle to obtain a phone, every phone she bought or was otherwise promised would end up in the dealers hand before she could post her first Snapchat story.</p>
    <p>Life quickly became difficult for Maybelline.  In school, she was ostricised from the other students who would often laugh and joke over the most current memes.  She was forced to play outside for fun.  The sunscreen she used while outside caused her particular trouble in her teenage years as her face filled with puss packets of SPF 30.</p>
